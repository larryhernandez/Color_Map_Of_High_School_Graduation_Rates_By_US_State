# Project Name
Color Map Of High School Graduation Rates By U.S. State

# Project Description
This is a visualization project. Public high school graduation rates, aggregated by state and select student groups, for the class of 2015 are color-mapped onto an OpenStreetMap representation of the United States.

# Final Output
The final product is an html document that includes description of the project, methods, sources of data, and a brief summary. The html document is located in this repository under the name [map_high_school_graduation_rates_50_united_states.html](https://github.com/larryhernandez/Color_Map_Of_High_School_Graduation_Rates_By_US_State/blob/master/map_high_school_graduation_rates_50_united_states.html). This html file is currently NOT rendering on github, but it can be downloaded and opened with Google Chrome and Internet Explorer. It might be viewable with other internet browsers, but I have not tried using any others.

Since the final html document cannot currently be rendered on github, a jpeg image of one of the color maps is presented below. The jpeg image was captured after clicking on North Dakota with the pointer, thereby revealing the data for that state. The jpeg image  is located in this repository and is also presented below ![The 2015 US National Gaduation Rate](https://github.com/larryhernandez/Color_Map_Of_High_School_Graduation_Rates_By_US_State/blob/master/ACGR_Map_A_Glimpse.jpg)
