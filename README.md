# Project Name
Color Map Of High School Graduation Rates By U.S. State

# Project Description
This is a visualization project. Public high school graduation rates, aggregated by state and select student groups, for the class of 2015 are color-mapped onto an OpenStreetMap representation of the United States.

# Final Output
The final product is an html document that includes description of the project, methods, sources of data, and a brief summary. The html document is located in this repository under the name[map_high_school_graduation_rates_50_united_states.html](https://github.com/larryhernandez/Color_Map_Of_High_School_Graduation_Rates_By_US_State/blob/master/map_high_school_graduation_rates_50_united_states.html). It is not currently viewable, but it can be downloaded.

Since the final html document cannot currently be rendered on github, I have provided a jpeg image of one of the color maps that is presented in the document. This jpeg image  is located in this repository, and is presented below ![The 2015 US National Graduation Rate](https://github.com/larryhernandez/Color_Map_Of_High_School_Graduation_Rates_By_US_State/blob/master/ACGR_Map_A_Glimpse.jpg)
